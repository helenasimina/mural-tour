1,MYArts Mural,,43.08545701,-89.37061677,"Welcome to the first stop on our tour of near East side Madison’s street art. Take a moment to look at these three colorful, abstract panels. They can be viewed altogether from across the street. What shapes do you see from afar? Move closer, and take a look at the detail within each shape. You might notice hands, eyes, and ears emerging from the colorful patterns. Commissioned by Madison Youth Arts (MYArts), these three panels were designed to represent the five senses. This project began in the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic, when MYArts was looking for a way to foster connections during a lonely time. Amy Zaremba helped design the mural with Dane Arts Mural Arts (DAMA) Community Project. While DAMA painters put together the larger panels, over seventy youth around Madison contributed hand-drawn designs that Yvette Pino later silk-screened onto the mural. This piece represents a massive collaborative undertaking during a time of separation.",Begin your tour outside of MYArts on N. Ingersoll St.,stop2.png,
2,Love Mural,,43.0801972,-89.36923009,"The mural before you has outlasted the business that originally commissioned it: Plan B nightclub, once one of Madison’s few gay bars. This work is part of a larger series that its painter, Michael Owen, started in Baltimore, Maryland, then brought to Madison in 2014. The timing was significant; same-sex marriage was not legal across all US states, but a growing movement pushing for legalization and acceptance had been rolling out campaigns using the phrase “Love is Love”. In October that year, Wisconsin legalized same-sex marriage. This was a big step forward for many in the LGBTQIA+ community, although it didn’t solve everything. This mural, while not explicitly tied to the “Love is Love” slogan, went up in a time when “Love” painted on the wall of a queer bar would carry extra meaning. Plan B eventually closed under allegations of discrimination, but the mural remains, now on the side of I/O Arcade Bar.",,stop3.png
3,Mother Fool's Permission Wall,,43.08205449,-89.36586053,"Once you walk past Mother Fool’s welcome sign, stop and turn to look at its outer brick wall. The graffiti that you see might not match up with the image here. This is because, in the true ephemeral spirit of street art, this wall is a rotating mural. Officially called the Permission Wall, this rotating art piece has been going since 2001, when Mother Fools and community advocates got permission from the Madison local government to install it. The wall features local artists who typically don’t have a wider audience, and changes seasonally. Anyone in Madison can apply to put their art up in aerosol paint. To see over 50 of the past murals, check out the Permission Wall page on Mother Fool’s website.",,stop4.png
4,Giant Pencil,,43.0874664,-89.36224812,"Even from across the train tracks, this mural grabs the attention of passersby. Located on the side of a building that houses State Line Distillery and Imaginary Factory Cocktail Bar, it depicts a yellow pencil, floating horizontally. Be careful as you cross the tracks to approach the mural. The origins of this pencil remain a mystery. The mural itself has no signature, and no local publications recounted when it first went up. In the true fashion of street art, its story remains with the artist. If you happen to stop and chat with anyone in a local business, see what you can find out about the enigmatic pencil.",,stop6.png
5,Indigenous Resilience Mural,,43.08720578,-89.3590396,"This mural stands out against the brick wall on Common Wealth Development. In collaboration with DAMA, ninipet (Michif, Anishinaabe) from Red Clover Tattoo Collective painted this piece to represent the Indigenous community’s response and resilience to the COVID-19 pandemic. It shows six Native women wearing patterned masks; ninipet commissioned six different Indigenous artists around Madison to design each pattern. From the left of the mural to the right, the artists are Yelihwakanyehs Powless (Oneida), Shaya Schreiber (Ojibwe), Arvina Martin (HoChunk, Stockbridge-Munsee), T Clearwater (Menominee), Paige Skenandore (Oneida), and Lucia Agostine (Ojibwe).",,stop5.png
6,Winnebago St. Alley Mural,,43.090703390586285,-89.35603615588015,"This mural, tucked away in an alley off of Winnebago St, was painted by Mike Lroy, an artist local to Madison. Take a moment to walk between these painted walls. On one side, large flowers break into a mosaic of teal and orange. On the other, geometric shapes in a similar color palette form an almost map-like pattern. The mosaic mural came first, but then Mike Lroy finished the opposite side in 2020. You can see Mike’s other work around town–quite literally on the street, as he was commissioned several years ago to beautify some of Madison’s rental Bcycles. You’ve now reached the end of this guided tour, but there is so much more art to see. Even on Winnebago street, other murals are just around the corner. Each has a story to tell, if you can find it.
